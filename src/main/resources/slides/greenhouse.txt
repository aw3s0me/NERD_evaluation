The Greenhouse Effect on Earth
Water On Earth
Greenhouse Gases
• The primary components of Earth’s atmosphere, N2 and O2 do not have absorption in the IR wavelength range, therefore, do not have a significant role in setting the surface temperature of the planet…
• Greenhouse gas are efficient in absorbing IR light…
The most important greenhouse gases are:
– H2O – Water vapor.
– CO2 – Carbon Dioxide
– CH4 – methane
The most abundant greenhouse gas in Earth’s atmosphere is water vapor. Most of the greenhouse heating of Earth’s atmosphere is due to Water vapor absorption of IR radiation emitted by Earth, and then transferring the energy to the surrounding air molecule

Source of Water
• Mt. St Helen eruption, 2004!
The Atmosphere of Earth
The atmosphere of Earth contains primarily N2 (77%) and O2 (21%). 
• What happened to all the CO2?
• Where did all the O2 come from?
CO2
CO2  is a colorless gas…
• condenses into solid form (dry ice) at -78°C in atmospheric pressure.
• condenses into liquid at -57°C at pressure above 5.1 atmospheric pressure. 

Atmospheric CO2 is derived from (The sources…)
• Volcanic outgassing
• burning of organic matter
• Respiration of living organisms
• …
CO2 can be stored in (The Sinks…)
• Highly soluble in water: forms H2CO3
• Dissolved CO2 in water can interact with silicate minerals to form carbonated minerals…
• …
Carbon Dioxide Cycle
The mechanism by which Earth self-regulates its temperature is called the carbon dioxide cycle, or the CO2 cycle for short. 
Starting with the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: 
• Volcanoes outgas CO2 into the atmosphere.
• Atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolves in the oceans. 
• At the same time, rainfall erodes rocks on Earth’s continents and rivers carry the eroded minerals to the oceans. 
• In the oceans, the eroded minerals combine with dissolved carbon dioxide and fall to the ocean floor, making carbonate rocks such as limestone. 
• Over millions of years, the conveyor belt of plate tectonics carries the carbonate rocks to subduction zones, and subduction carries them down into the mantle. 
• As they are pushed deeper into the mantle, some of the subducted carbonate rock melts and releases its carbon dioxide, which then outgasses back into the atmosphere through volcanoes.

The CO2 Cycle
Feedback Loop
• Positive Feedback 
– Mechanisms that make things worse…
– e.g., Increasing CO2 in the atmosphere leading to the release of more CO2
• Negative Feedback
– Mechanisms that are self-correcting…
– e.g., Increasing CO2 in the atmosphere leading to higher rate of CO2  removal, such as our CO2 cycle.

Plate Tectonics
	Plate tectonics plays an important role in the CO2 cycle in that it helps to carry the carbonate rocks into the mantle, which are then released again by volcanic activities.
– Earth’s lithosphere is broken into pieces (the plates).
– These plates float on top of the mantle, interacting with each other to produce the geological features we see and feel today.
