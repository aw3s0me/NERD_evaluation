What is Hanukkah celebrating?
An eight-day festival celebrating a time in
history when the Jews won a battle against
the Greeks to practise their religion freely. 
Why does it last for 8 days?
• To celebrate, an oil lamp was lit in the temple. There was only enough oil to burn for one day - but miraculously it burned for eight days. 
• This is why the Hanukkah festival lasts for eight days and why light is the main item in the celebration. 

• How long do our celebrations last?
• What was the miracle?
What is a Hanukkiah?






They light a candle each night on a special

them, like when the light lasted for 8 days in
history.
