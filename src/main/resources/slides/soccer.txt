PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS
OF YOUTH SOCCER
COMPETITIVE READINESS?
“Most children are not psychologically ready for competitive sport until they are 10-12 years old”
COMPETITIVE READINESS
? This perspective does not mean children cannot learn soccer skills, enjoy soccer,and develop fitness and health
? However, it does mean that children do not understand the competition process the way adults do
? Thus, adults should help children define and understand their soccer experience

COMPETITIVE READINESS
? Cognitive maturity
? Spatial ability
? Understanding ability
? Effort vs. ability
? Realistic appraisal of ability
SOCCER MOTIVATION
?  Being with friends
?  Playing 
?  Excitement 
?  Learning
?  Improving

THE IMPORTANCE OF PERCEPTIONS OF ABILITY
“Sport psychologists believe that the major underlying reason for participating in and leaving sport are perceptions of ability9.”

PERCEPTIONS OF ABILITY INFORMATION SOURCES
?  8-14 yrs vs. 14-18yrs
?  Evaluative Feedback: 1 vs. 3 dimensions (coach, peer, spectators)
?  Internal information: 1 vs. 3 dimensions (effort, skill, ease of learning)

HOW CHILDREN PLAY WHEN THEY ARE IN CHARGE
? Potential evidence about how coaches may want to structure practice and games.

CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILDREN ONLY PLAY
? Lots of action
? Lots of personal involvement in the action
? Close scores – no blowouts
? Challenges strongly match skills
? Opportunities to affirm friendships
RAMIFICATIONS FOR COACHING 
COACHING PHILOSOPHY
? Professional model vs. Educational and Developmental model

PROFESSIONAL MODEL
? Entertainment
? Success = winning
? Failure = losing
EDUCATIONAL MODEL
? Multiple definitions of success
? Success = learning, improvement
? Success = love of physical activity, health, fitness
? Success = developing desirable personal qualities (e.g., confidence)
? Success = friendships, fun, good memories
EDUCATIONAL MODEL
? Fewer definitions of failure
? Failure = not trying hard, not persisting, giving up
? Failure = poor sportpersonship, unethical behavior
TEAM GOALS
? Think short and long term
? The practice, the current season, next season
? A lifelong love of physical activity and sport
? Create an atmosphere so that children want to come to practice
COACH CREATED CLIMATE
? Create a performance (vs. outcome) oriented atmosphere
? De-emphasize winning:  Its often uncontrollable and unrealistic
? Children will be exposed to plenty of information stressing the importance of winning
(e.g., fun, attention, rewards, etc.)
COACH CREATED CLIMATE
? Emphasize controllable and realistic performance goals such as skill development, fitness improvement, learning, etc.
? Create opportunities for fun and socialization

A FEW PARTING EMPIRICAL RESEARCH RESULTS
? One of the strongest predictors of stress in youth sport is the child’s sense of how important winning is to adults
? Coaches who became more positive (e.g., encouraging) drastically reduced children’s drop out rates and increase their self-esteem
