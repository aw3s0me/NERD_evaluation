Comedy	
* Definition: a drama, novel, film, text that moves toward a happy ending and implies a re-ordering of the world. 
* Plot structure is that at the beginning the world is “out of order” but through the course of the play the natural/normal order is restored equaling a “happy ending”
* Comedies often have humor, but it is not a prerequisite
e. g. The Divine Comedy by Dante


Comedy Cont. 
* Comedies often take us to the brink of tragedy, but it is the lack of death or serious harm that make these plots a comedy.
* Comedies focus on a group or a community, and often have general titles because of it. 
* Comedies usually resolve in the last 5 minutes and often end in marriage. 
* Types of comedy: farce, satire, slapstick, intrigue comedy, romantic comedy, tragicomedy, religious comedy, black comedy and mannered comedy. 
* Shakespeare always mixes the types of comedy in his plays never adhering to just one format. 
Tragedy
* Tragedy is when a text moves from order to disorder
* Tragedy usually focuses on one individual not the society as a whole
* The end of the play should bring about a catharsis 
* The hero of a tragedy is usually of an elite class and has a “tragic flaw” that will be exposed and exploited through the play
* Tragedy involves choices and there consequences
* Often have a fatalistic tone


Romance 
* "Romance" was not a generic classification in Shakespeare's time.  The modern term "romance" refers to a new kind of play, a hybrid of comic and tragic elements
* It was developed by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher with their play Plilaster in 1609
* Shakespeare took on this genre at the end of his career with: The Tempest, The Winter’s Tale, Cymbeline, and Pericles  


Romance Cont. 
* Sometimes called tragi-comedies because they combine elements of those two genres. 
* Plots of romances involve a tragic event that leads to reconciliation or restoration and forgiveness 
* However, the endings are always muted happiness as opposed to the “pure” happiness of a comedy
* Plots usually focus on the whole human community and healing rifts. 
* Finally, the plots of romances always contain supernatural elements
* Characters are either larger than life or one-dimensional
History
•  History plays focus on historical events, but often contain opinionated subtext about the event
• Shakespeare wrote about two types of history: Roman and English
• For the English Histories, Holinshed's Chronicles (1587), but he also drew on other sources, e.g. the anonymous history play The Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth (1598)	
• The main source for the Roman plays was Plutarch (which Shakespeare would have studied in grammar school)
The Problem Plays
* These plays focus on a problem in society, but they have no true solution or ending; instead, their endings are awkward.  
* In these plays, the situation faced by the protagonist is put forward by the author as a representative instance of a contemporary social problem
* Shakespeare's "problem plays" set out to explore specific moral dilemmas and social problems through their central characters. 
* The problem plays are characterized by their complex and ambiguous tone, which shifts violently between dark, psychological drama and more straightforward comic material
Theater in the Ren. 
* Theater was NOT a high class affair. 
* It was a red light district activity, which meant that it was competing with Bear baiting, sex shows, sword fights, punch and judy shows, etc. for an audience
* Pick pockets were a major concern at theater
* All the actors were men
* The classes were separated in the theater seating.
